# Application backstory

One of the guys at work, Derek, is some kind of VIM prodigy. He works in
tmux, because it is "the only way to code". He switches between
workspaces so rapidly that he gave the product person with epilepsy a
seizure, just watching him work.

Last week, he was frustrated by our story board, which has a special menu
called 'Agile'. You understand his frustration. The story software seems more
geared towards building gantt charts than making developers productive. Derek
started building a command line app that tracks todo lists. He can pop this app
up in one of his tmux panels and is off to the races. It is keeping him on
track, which is hard to accomplish with his focus issues. Derek aims never to
converse with the 'Agile' menu again.

The rest of the team LOVES THIS TASK APP! The team is totally convinced that
with some polish this could be a world class application for keeping track of
work while never touching a mouse again.

Product resources have been taken off the company's other
endeavors to support this boost to productivity. There are stories
that set the trajectory of the app, along with bugs.
